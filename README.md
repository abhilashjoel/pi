# Pi
A simple c program to compute the value of the constant pi(3.141592653..) with a precision of around few thousand decimal places. 
This program represents the digits of the number using an integer array. All mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root are defined as functions. These operations use the high precision numbers that are stored as an array to compute the result.
This program uses the Gaussâ€“Legendre algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm) which has an exponential convergence i.e. with each iteration, the precision doubles.
